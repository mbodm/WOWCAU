# WOWCAU
My most recent WoW Curseforge addons updater

### What is WOWCAU?
- It's a simple World of Warcraft addon updater for CurseForge addons
- WOWCAU (pronounced like \[_wow-cow_\]) means "_**W**orld **o**f **W**arcraft **C**urse **A**ddon **U**pdater_"
- WOWCAU is the official next generation [WOWCAM](https://github.com/MBODM/WOWCAM) (which was the official [WADM](https://github.com/MBODM/WADM) successor 😄)!
